  <p> In here we are about to experiment with different of text within the paragraph.
    The purpose with this lesson is to learn how to use HTML, Then CSS and last JS.
    <br>Afterward, we will be able to combine those 3 elements with Java.
    <br>When the four elements has been combined we will be able to create a Frontend and a Backend
    Which is the goal to learn how to become a partial programmer.</p>

  <p> <strong> This is our first time using HTML ever before.</strong> We have some knowledge about how the language work
    but never have we been using it. <br>This is an exciting event as there is many new ways to learn how
    a computer operates and that truly is amazing. <br>Someday when computers will take over the world
    <br>
    I might have some knowledge on how they work to support.</p>
